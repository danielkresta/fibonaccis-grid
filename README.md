The project is supposed to find solution to the following:

```
Create a grid of 50x50. When you click on a cell, all values in the cells in the same row and column are increased  by 1. If a cell is empty, it will get a value of 1. After each change a cell will briefly turn yellow. If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will be cleared. Use the programming language of your choice.
```

As I'm still exploring React, I decided to make it harder for me by using it. I decided to go with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
